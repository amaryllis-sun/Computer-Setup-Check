I learned a lot in class today, ideas ranging from our definition of artificial intelligence to the timeline of it. I learned that AI is a very broad field with a bright future, since the subject is still relatively new. I downloaded 3 programs today (Miniconda, VS Code, and GitHub) for class, which I am excited to use in the future.
